# Counting the number of set bits in a given number
For example the input `5` which has the following binary representation `bin(5) == 0b101` the result would be `2`

The code implements three sulution that are tested against each other:
* Naive solution
* `n = n*(n-1)` solution
* Lookup table solution
All of the approaches implemented are covered at the [following page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-set-bits-in-an-integer/)
